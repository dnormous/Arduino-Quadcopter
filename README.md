# Arduino-Quadcopter

The DQ_V6_3.ino file  my last revision of an arduino based flight controller for a quadcopter.

The script has many pieces of functional code (ie: motor spin up, rx input via SBUS, PID for balance).  

!However, the code has yet to be perfected to allow stable flight.  FurtherPID testing and code adjustments are required.

Hardware:
Arduino Mega
AltIMU-10 Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, and Altimeter (L3GD20, LSM303DLHC, and LPS331AP)
FrSky X6R 16ch Receiver, SBUS, Smart Port

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in branching the code.

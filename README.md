# Arduino-Quadcopter

The DQ_V6_3.ino file is  my last revision of an Arduino Mega based flight controller for a 450mm quadcopter.

The script has many pieces of functional code (ie: motor control, rx input via SBUS, PID for balance).  

!However, the code has yet to be perfected to allow stable flight.  Further PID testing and code adjustments are required.

Hardware:
Arduino Mega
AltIMU-10 Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, and Altimeter (L3GD20, LSM303DLHC, and LPS331AP)
FrSky X6R 16ch Receiver, SBUS, Smart Port

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in branching the code.

This project was last visited Fall 2015.  Added to Git for storage in May 2016.
